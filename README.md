## About The Project

![Screen Shot](images/screenshot.png)

###### Another Wallpaper changer on GitHub but this one is quite customizable and powerful.

##### With this you can -

1) Change your wallpaper **automatically after specified time delay**. 
2) Get them **from Unsplash** which is an excellent source of High Quality images, best for being PC wallpapers.
3) Get wallpapers with **your own keywords** !
   
4)  ```Don't wanna use Unsplash?```
 Add your own **local wallpapers** !

5) ``` Too tired to do it manually?```
 Simply provide a url and it'll directly **change wallpaper from the given link!**
6) And **much more** !!


Here's why:

* I rarely used to change wallpapers because it was such a hassle doing it manually from time to time but with this I get to see so much better and high quality wallpapers without ever bothering about it.
* Also not gonna lie, making it was fun.

## Built With

##### ~ Python


## Getting Started

* Run the **main_file** to begin changing wallpapers.
* Go to **settings**  for customization.
* For **Local wallpapers** move your wallpapers to **'Wallpaper Folder'**.

## Usage

I have tried to make it as user friendly as I could.
The **settings** script has functions as follows:
1) Change wallpaper (manually)
2) Save wallpaper in a 'Saved wallpapers' folder
3) Save wallpaper as-
4) Settings:
    * Change keywords
    * Change time delay
    * Provide custom link to get wallpapers from
    * Change the source of wallpapers (i.e. either from unsplash, or locally specified or from custom link)
